Hello there!

This a template sketch file that you can use to start creating using the power of soundEngine.

There are five main variables you can access that give out values, they spit out values between 0 and 255 :
    - bass
    - lowMid
    - mid
    - highMid
    - treble
    - level (from 0 to 1)

For future reference, the only functions you need for this to function is use "setupSound" in setup and "drawSound" in setup!

If you want examples please look in the examples folder included.

Thanks,
effeect
